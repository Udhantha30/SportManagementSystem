                                        Rugby is a fast-paced and physically demanding team sport played with an oval ball.
                                        The game involves two teams, each aiming to score points by carrying, passing, or 
                                        kicking the ball into the opponent's end zone, known as the try line.

                                        Rugby's roots can be traced back to England in the early 19th century. Legend has
                                        it that during a football (soccer) match at Rugby School in 1823, a student named
                                        William Webb Ellis picked up the ball and ran with it, thus giving birth to a new 
                                        form of the game.
                                    </p>
                                    <p style="margin-top:20px">
                                        In the following years, the sport evolved at Rugby School and other British institutions,
                                        gradually forming its own set of rules distinct from association football (soccer).
                                        The first written rules for rugby were drawn up in 1845 at Rugby School.

                                    <p style="margin-top:20px">
                                        As rugby's popularity grew, efforts were made to standardize the rules to allow for 
                                        consistent play across different clubs and schools. In 1871, the Rugby Football Union (RFU) 
                                        was formed in England, becoming the sport's governing body and establishing the first official 
                                        set of rules.

                                        In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, rugby started to spread beyond the British Isles to 
                                        other parts of the world. It gained popularity in countries like Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, 
                                        and the Pacific Island nations, where it became deeply rooted in the culture.

                                        The sport's global appeal led to the establishment of international competitions. The first Rugby World

                                        The objective of rugby is to score points by advancing the ball into the opponent's 
                                        territory and grounding it across their try line, known as a "try," which is worth 
                                        five points. Additional points can be earned through conversions, penalty kicks, or 
                                        drop goals. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins. Defensively, 
                                        teams aim to prevent the opposing team from scoring while striving to gain possession 
                                        of the ball through tackles and strategic play.

                                        Rugby gametime refers to the duration of a rugby match, during which the two teams compete to 
                                        score points and secure victory. A standard rugby match typically consists of two halves, each 
                                        lasting 40 minutes, with a 10-minute halftime break in between. However, there are variations in 
                                        different formats of the game, such as Rugby Sevens, which has shorter match durations. During gametime, 
                                        players showcase their skills, endurance, and teamwork in a physically demanding and action-packed 
                                        sport that captivates fans worldwide.
