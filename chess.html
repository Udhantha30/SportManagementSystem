                                        millennium. Its origins can be traced back to ancient Indian and Persian games, with the earliest 
                                        predecessor being Chaturanga in the 6th century AD. As it spread to Persia and the Islamic world, 
                                        the game evolved into Shatranj during the 7th century, introducing a checkered board and modified 
                                        rules.

                                    <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">STARTING PLAY</h3>
                                    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                                        At the beginning of the game, the pieces are set up in a specific arrangement. The two players alternate 
                                        making moves throughout the game. White always moves first, followed by black. The player controlling the 
                                        white pieces is referred to as "White," while the one with black pieces is "Black."
                                    </p>

                                    <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">MOVEMENT AND CAPTURE</h3>
                                    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                                        Each chess piece has its unique movement and capturing abilities. The king moves one square in any direction, 
                                        while the queen can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally across the board. Rooks move horizontally 
                                        and vertically, bishops diagonally, and knights in an L-shaped pattern. Pawns move forward, but capture diagonally. 
                                        A piece captures an opponent's piece by moving to the square occupied by that piece, removing it from the board.


                                    <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">SCORING</h3>
                                    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                                        The objective in chess is not to score points but to achieve checkmate, ending the game. If a player successfully 
                                        puts the opponent's king in a position where it cannot escape capture on the next move, it's checkmate, and the 
                                        game is over. A check is declared when a king is under threat, and the player must make a move to remove the threat.
                                    </p>

                                    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                                        The game of chess requires players to develop various fundamental skills, such as:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">

                                            <p>Analyzing the board and assessing positions</p>
                                        </li>

                                    </ul>

                                    <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">GAME DURATION</h3>
                                    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                                        Chess games do not have fixed time limits; the duration of a game can vary widely. 
                                        In competitive chess, players may have a set amount of time to complete all their 
                                        moves, usually measured in minutes per player (e.g., 15 minutes each). 
                                        Additionally, longer tournament games can have time controls that allow players 
                                        to receive additional time after each move.
                                        
                                        Chess games can last anywhere from a few minutes in blitz chess to several hours 
                                        in classical tournament games, ensuring a diverse and engaging experience for players 
                                        of all levels.
